# bilshell
This is a simple shell interface for Linux that I coded as part of a project in my CS342 Operating Systems course.

-bilshell allows for execution of bash shell commands by forking and executing as children the corresponding system program.

-bilshell also allows up to one pipe ('|') in the commandline and has its own arrangement of pipe to execute the resulting command.

-It also has the capacity to execute bash shell commands from file if you provide each command on a separate line in a text file.
